Java Programming Project - CodeSoft Internship

Overview:-
This repository contains three Java-based mini-projects developed as part of the CodeSoft Internship Program.
The projects focus on applying core Java concepts such as OOP, data handling, and user interaction via console applications.

The following tasks are implemented:
1-Student Management System
2-Currency Converter
3-Student Grade Calculator

Each program is designed to run on the console and demonstrates clean coding, modular structure, and reusability of methods.

🏫 Task 1: Student Management System
🔹 Description
A console-based application to manage student details.

The program allows the user to:
-Add new student details
-Display all students
-Search a student by ID
-Update student information
-Delete a student

🔹 Features
Object-Oriented Design using classes and objects
Uses ArrayList (or arrays) for data storage
Menu-driven interface for smooth navigation

Task 2: Currency Converter
🔹 Description
A Java console-based program that converts one currency into another.
It takes input from the user (amount + currency type) and converts it into the desired currency.

🔹 Features
-Supports conversion between common currencies (e.g., INR, USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.)
-Predefined exchange rates stored inside the program
-User-friendly menu system

Task 3: Student Grade Calculator
🔹 Description
This program calculates the average percentage and assigns a grade based on student marks.

🔹 Features
-Accepts marks of multiple subjects
-Calculates:
-Total Marks
-Average Percentage
-Grade (A, B, C, D, F)
-Uses simple if-else conditions for grade calculation

🔹Technologies Used
Java (JDK 8 or above)
Console-based I/O (Scanner class)

This project demonstrates the application of Java fundamentals in building small but useful console-based applications.
Each task highlights different problem-solving aspects:

Task 1: Data management and CRUD operations

Task 2: Mathematical computation and decision-making

Task 3: Conditional logic and user input handling
